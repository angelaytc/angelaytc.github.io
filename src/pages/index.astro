          <h3>About me</h3>
          <p>
            "Angela YT Chan is an independent researcher, data engineer and artist specialising in climate change. Her multidisciplinary work examines power in relation to the inequity throughout the colonial and ongoing history of the climate crisis, through self-archiving, data science, technologies, rethinking geographies and speculative fiction. 
            Her recent research-art commissions use video, illustrations, conversations and other research media to focus on water scarcity, conflict and everyday experiences through climate framings and communications. 
            Since 2014, Angela has produced curatorial projects and workshops, collaborating with artists, activists and youth groups (formerly as <a href="/arts_curatorial">Worm: art + ecology</a>). She co-directs the <a href="http://www.lsfrc.co.uk/">London Science Fiction Research Community</a>
            As an educator, she teaches undergraduate and postgraduate students in climate colonialism, environmental and social justice in fine art practices, critical research-arts, games and speculative fiction (Goldsmiths UoL, KCL, RCA, WSA) and supervises dissertations in media theory and games on the MA Global Media Management at Winchester School of Art, University of Southampton."
            Angela is also a research consultant, having worked in international climate and cultural policy and on climate and sustainability projects for major cultural institutions. </a>.
